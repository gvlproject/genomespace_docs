# JavaScript User Interface

- The JS/HTML/CSS is under src -> main -> webapp.
- This is by far the easiest part of GS.
- All the folders should be pretty self-explanatory.
- The menu's are built dynamically using javascript (menu.js).
- Uploads are done client-side (javascript).
- The easiest way to debug issues in JSUI is by copying text from the part of the interface and searching for it.
