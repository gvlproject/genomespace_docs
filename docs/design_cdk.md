# Client Development Kit

Documentation for this can be found on the Broad's website (genomespace.org).

Design overview similar to GS itself, there's a client for analysis & tool manager, data manager, group manager, and user manager.

This is used in the sepsis project- we added a swift upload function, and a test script can be found at https://github.com/madiflannery/genomespace_cdk_test
